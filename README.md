# Contextualized_metabolic_models
Python pipeline for contextualizing and sampling E. coli metabolic models using transcriptomic data. Integrates Riptide for expression-guided optimization and COBRApy for flux sampling, enabling parallel analyses and saving condition-specific models and results for comparative metabolic studies.

## Overview

This repository provides a **complete computational pipeline** for **contextualizing and sampling metabolic models** of *E. coli* based on transcriptomic data.  

The workflow integrates:
- **Riptide** for gene expression–guided model contextualization  
- **COBRApy** for flux sampling of context-specific models  
- **Parallel processing** for high-throughput execution across multiple experimental conditions  

The goal is to generate condition-specific models (raw and normalized) and extract their metabolic flux distributions for downstream comparative analysis.

## 🧩 Workflow Summary

### 1. Data Preparation
- Inputs:  
  - Experimental metadata (`41467_2019_13483_MOESM4_ESM.xlsx`)  
  - Gene expression matrix (log₂ TPM) in the same file  
  - Gene copy number / multiplicity data (`raw_molteplicity.xlsx`)  
- The pipeline filters valid samples based on:
  - Positive growth rate  
  - *E. coli* grown in M9 minimal medium  
  - Specific carbon sources (e.g., acetate or others)

### 2. Contextual Model Optimization (Riptide)
- Each filtered condition is used to generate a contextualized model with Riptide.
- The script:
  - Builds a condition-specific model from **iML1515**  
  - Sets up the M9 medium composition and adjusts carbon uptake to match experimental growth rate  
  - Runs `riptide.maxfit()` with the corresponding transcriptomic profile  
  - Automatically kills any process exceeding a time limit (default: 1500 s)

Outputs are stored as SBML models under:
```
raw_exp_maxfit_riptide_runs_iML1515/
normalized_exp_maxfit_riptide_runs_iML1515/
```

### 3. Flux Sampling (COBRApy)
- For each contextualized model (raw and normalized), the pipeline performs:
  - **Flux sampling** using `OptGPSampler` (1000 samples, thinning = 100)
  - Parallel execution for raw and normalized models of the same condition
- Results are saved as:
```
cobrapy_samples/<condition>/
│
├── raw_flux_sampling.csv
└── normalized_flux_sampling.csv
```

### 4. Integration and Analysis
- Each run can be associated with metadata such as:
  - Growth rate  
  - Condition name  
  - Additional metrics (e.g., Tao times, distances between raw and normalized flux states)

## ⚙️ Installation & Requirements

### 1. Create a Python environment
```bash
python3 -m venv ecoli_env
source ecoli_env/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install cobra riptide pandas numpy openpyxl tqdm gurobipy
```

> 💡 Note:  
> Gurobi requires a valid license (academic or commercial) to be used as solver in COBRApy.  
> You can alternatively switch to `optlang.glpk_interface` if you don't have one.

### 3. Prepare input data
Ensure the following files are present in the root directory:
- `iML1515.xml`
- `41467_2019_13483_MOESM4_ESM.xlsx`
- `raw_molteplicity.xlsx`

## 🚀 Running the Pipeline

### Step 1 — Generate contextualized models
```bash
python3 riptide_pipeline.py
```
This step:
- Loads and filters metadata
- Runs Riptide optimizations in parallel (configurable threads)
- Saves optimized SBML models for each condition

### Step 2 — Perform flux sampling
```bash
python3 flux_sampling_pipeline.py
```
This step:
- Loads the Riptide-optimized models (raw + normalized)
- Performs flux sampling using COBRApy’s `OptGPSampler`
- Saves sampled flux distributions for each condition

## ⚡ Parallelization Control

Both scripts are designed for **parallel execution**:

| Parameter | Script | Description | Default |
|------------|---------|-------------|----------|
| `threads_number` | `riptide_pipeline.py` | Number of Riptide processes to run simultaneously | `2` |
| `timeout_value`  | `riptide_pipeline.py` | Max seconds before a Riptide process is killed | `1500` |
| `processes` | `flux_sampling_pipeline.py` | Number of parallel sampling jobs (raw + normalized per condition) | `2` |

---

## 📊 Output Overview

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `raw_flux_sampling.csv` | Flux distribution matrix from raw contextual model |
| `normalized_flux_sampling.csv` | Flux distribution matrix from normalized contextual model |
| `terminated.txt` | List of Riptide processes that were terminated due to timeout |
| `report.csv` *(optional)* | Summary of per-condition metrics (growth, tao, flux distances) |

---

## 🧠 Notes & Tips

- The filtering functions (`filter_dataset`) automatically merge biological replicates by averaging log₂ TPM values.
- Expression values are converted back from log₂ TPM to TPM before being passed to Riptide.
- If the number of conditions is large, consider increasing `threads_number` and `processes` depending on your CPU core availability.
- To visualize sampling results, use tools such as:
  ```python
  import pandas as pd
  df = pd.read_csv('cobrapy_samples/glucose/raw_flux_sampling.csv')
  df.describe()
  ```

## 📈 Example: Typical Workflow

```bash
# 1. Generate Riptide contextual models
python3 riptide_pipeline.py

# 2. Run flux sampling
python3 flux_sampling_pipeline.py

# 3. Inspect outputs
ls cobrapy_samples/
```

Output:
```
acetate/
glucose/
...
```

Each folder contains the flux sampling CSVs for raw and normalized contextual models.
